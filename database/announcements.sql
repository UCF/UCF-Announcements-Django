She was a poor black tobacco farmer whose cells--taken without her knowledge in 1951--became one of the most important tools in medicine, vital for developing the polio vaccine, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization, and more. Henrietta\'s cells have been bought and sold by the billions, yet she remains virtually unknown, and her family can\'t afford health insurance. Soon to be made into an HBO movie by Oprah Winfrey and Alan Ball, this New York Times bestseller takes readers on an extraordinary journey, from the \"colored\" ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers filled with HeLa cells, from Henrietta\'s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia, to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells a riveting story of the collision between ethics, race, and medicine; of scientific discovery and faith healing; and of a daughter consumed with questions about the mother she never knew. It\'s a story inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we\'re made of.

The aim of the project is to better understand the complex relationships among children’s attention, memory, and activity level. Parents are provided a free, written, comprehensive psychoeducational report that includes detailed summaries of their child’s standardized intelligence (WISC-IV) and academic achievement test (Kaufman Test of Academic Achievement) performance, a comprehensive assessment of their child’s short-term memory, working memory, long-term memory, visual problem solving abilities, their ability to sustain attention over time, and objective measurement of activity level.\nAll parents receive a comprehensive report detailing the results of the assessment, and specific recommendations relevant to optimizing learning and memory in their children. A telephone interview (~10 minutes) asks questions about your child’s behavior to determine initial project eligibility. Standardized parent and teacher questionnaires are sent subsequently to parents in stamped envelopes.\nParticipation in the project requires attendance for 2-4 sessions to complete historical and developmental interviews (parent) and standardized testing (child), as well as four, 3-hour visits (children can be dropped off and picked up at the CLC-IV for these sessions) scheduled one-week apart (on Saturdays during the academic years; on weekdays during the summer months) to assess memory and other cognitive abilities. Children play games during multiple breaks and receive a prize for their participation each week.

She is considered by her supervisors as an extremely hard-working employee and that her commitment to co-workers, her department and the University of Central Florida as a whole is unparalleled. “Whenever necessary she works (late), never complains and shows a devotion to the program that (they) have never observed in other individuals in her position in the last five years.  Her dedication and work ethic exemplifies the UCF creed and she works this way because she believes in what she does – not because she expects special recognition.” From the time she began working at UCF Donna has been considered a consummate professional who has mastered her ever-expanding role and increased duties within the department. “Ms. Lucas does not just DO her job, she EXCELS at it” noted one of her supervisors. This commitment to excellence has led her to being promoted twice since she began working in Psychology May of 2009.

The four little girls who attended the 16th Street Baptist Church were no exception. Four Little Girls: Birmingham 1963 centers on Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley, and Addie Mae Collins, four little girls who are multi-talented and bursting with promise and who share their hopes and dreams against the backdrop of the civil rights movement. While Denise dreams of becoming a doctor, Carole looks forward to the dress she will one day wear at the cotillion, Cynthia imagines her life as a mathematics professor at the local university, and Addie Mae envisions a life as a professional baseball player. The realities of the segregated political climate that will put a stop to these dreams swirl around them and eventually culminate in the fateful events of September 15, 1963. This play examines what it is like to be a child in the most extreme circumstances. </p>','2013-09-11','2013-09-15','http://www.facebook.com/events/334535890025608/?ref=br_tf','Tara Kromer','(336)391-2388','tara.kromer@knights.ucf.edu','Tara Kromer','Publish',1),(1810,'Omicron Delta Kappa National Leadership Honor Society applications','omicron-delta-kappa-national-leadership-honor-society-applications','<p>The Omicron Delta Kappa Society is the national leadership honor society for college students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni that recognizes and encourages superior scholarship, leadership, and exemplary character.</p>\n<p>The student and faculty members of Omicron Delta Kappa work closely together to foster leadership abilities within its members.

He has a deep understanding of federal real property policies and issues. His expertise includes oversight and commitment to Presidentially-directed management requirements for the government’s federal real properties, which includes operating and maintaining assets in the right condition at the right cost, disposing of excess and underutilized properties, obtaining “best value” based leases, Portfolio Stat, and the Space Consolidation Initiative.</p>\n<p>Negotiation lies at the heart of international diplomacy. Governments, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations employ the art and science of negotiation to protect and advance their organizational and constituent interests. An effective negotiation process can lead to positive outcomes that can result in the promotion of important international objectives including economic development, business interests, environmental protection, labor rights, and political stability, all of which can minimize the adverse impacts of poverty that can lead to violence and war.</p>\n<p>One of the things in human conflict that people often misunderstand is the extent to which the human element enters into the conflict. The function of mediation is to help narrow gaps and then bridge them.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they are so wide that you cannot build a bridge that wide and look for that common ground. Where does the mutual interest lie? How do you find it? How do you persuade diverse views to reach that final point of, if not agreement, at least understanding? If not from formal acceptance, at least a willingness to state a condition (by a condition I mean fact, not a prelude). It may not be the foundation of some sort of strategic understanding. It may not be a long-term proposition. Generally speaking, it will only be a part of any diplomat\'s life for a very brief moment. It is not something that you train for.

Several methods have been surveyed to protect optical or photovoltaic surfaces from the dust deposition threat but limiting condition of lunar and Martian environment makes them either inefficient or infeasible. Since there is no drag force on particles, and the magnetic field is negligible, applying electrostatic field could be the best approach for dust control.</p>\n<p>The unique properties of ITO, Graphene and Carbon Nanotube (CNT) combined with recent scientific advancements that make these materials readily available allow development of smart surfaces on a small and large scale that will benefit the power generation devices. Our research groups from UCF and UF in collaboration with KSC have been working on high and low voltage technologies like Electrodynamic Dust Shield (EDS) and Electrostatic Lunar Dust Collector (ELDC) for future lunar and Mars Missions.</p>\n<p>The research team developed active and very efficient cleaning methods based on ITO, Graphene and CNT materials requiring minimal cost, weight, and power that repel and remove particulate buildup of surface contaminants, e.g., dust and dirt, from solar panels used for the space mission. The cleaning methods ensure that solar panels are operational for longer periods of time and with lower power loss due to dust obscuration.</p>\n<p>For further information please visit:\n<a href=\"http://fsi.ucf.edu/seminars/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://fsi.ucf.edu/seminars/</a></p>','2014-01-21','2014-01-22','http://fsi.ucf.edu/seminars/ ','Patricia Szczerba','(407)823-6351','patricia.szczerba@ucf.edu','patricia szczerba','Publish',1),(1898,'Research Computing Day to Showcase UCF\'s High Performance Systems','research-computing-day-to-showcase-ucfs-high-performance-systems','<p>Find out how high performance computers are increasingly needed for advanced research during a half-day series of presentations to be held at the STOKES Advanced Research Computing Center headquarters in the Central Florida Research Park next to campus.</p>\n<p>The event is set for Tuesday, Feb. 11, from 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at the Partnership III Building, 3039 Technology Parkway.

Dr. Peter Brown is one of the leading experts on this event and will speak on the explosion and the hazards to Earth poised by small asteroids. The impact hazard at the Earth due to small asteroids is uncertain. The root of this uncertainty is the poorly understood interaction of small asteroids in the atmosphere together with the associated impact effects at the ground together with the poorly constrained number of small objects impacting Earth. The Chelyabinsk airburst has provided detailed data on a well-observed damage-producing airburst for the first time. In this talk Dr. Brown will describe what we have learned about the Chelyabinsk airburst in the year since it occurred and what it may tell us more broadly about the effects we can expect from future impacts at the Earth.</p>\n<p>The Speaker:\nProfessor Peter Brown, Ph.D. is a Distinguished Research Professor in the Faculty of Science at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada. He is the Director of the Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration at Western University.

These students are 3rd/4th year university students who have been accepted into the new LEAD Scholars Academy track program. This experience will include 10 hours per week for 15 weeks during the spring semester.</p>\n<p>This program will allow LEAD Scholars in any field of study an opportunity to learn and develop their skills within that career area. Students will be matched with faculty applicants who wish to mentor and supervise an undergraduate in their field of research.</p>\n<p>We believe that allowing LEAD Scholars to start exploring and participating in career and research related experiences early on in their college career will allow students to be more likely to create realistic and detailed career plans to follow for the remainder of their time in college.</p>\n<p>A unique aspect of this program is the mentor relationship that is created. The faculty or staff member that is paired with students will be expected to create and facilitate a mentor/mentee relationship with LEAD students; hopefully this relationship will continue to grow and benefit both parties throughout the students’ time at UCF and beyond.</p>\n<p>This program differs from most career related programs at UCF in the fact that it is only one (1) semester and is only available to UCF departments and offices.</p>\n<p>If selected, there is a mandatory training session that students and faculty/staff must attend.

The performance examines one of the most important conversations of our time---a contemplation of the paths before us, and the power we hold within ourselves to set a new path. At the center of Crossroads is its music, performed live by a quartet of classical musicians. The Project combines musical performance and the spoken word with scientific visualizations and art as it presents an evocative and powerful perspective on climate science.\nIn a feature story in NPR’s “All Things Considered,” physicist Robert Davies, the founder of the Crossroads Project, described why he started this important endeavor. As a scientist, he said he was taken aback by \"the broad gap between what science understands about climate change, and what the public understands.\" He realized that public lectures on the fate of our planet due to climate change were not compelling people to take action. His passion for finding ways to motivate change led him to leave his work in Oxford, England for work in the United States at the Utah State University Climate Center. It was here that the idea of a performance combining art with science became a reality. In the Crossroads Project, the Fry Street Quartet performs commissioned music composed by composer Laura Kaminsky. Evocative images taken by nature photographers Garth Lenz, Lu Guang, and Joel Sartore, and projections of nature-inspired paintings by Rebecca Allan, are presented behind the musicians.\nThis Crossroads Project visit to UCF is organized by the\nDepartment of Philosophy Ethics Center Initiative and the Office of Interdisciplinary Studies.</p>','2016-02-22','2016-02-22','http://www.ist.ucf.edu/crossroads/','Dr. Steve Fiore',NULL,'sfiore@ist.ucf.edu','Dr. Claudia Schippert','Publish',1),(2233,'Security B-Sides Orlando Conference @ UCF March 12-13','security-b-sides-orlando-conference-ucf-march-12-13','<p>WHAT: Security B-Sides Orlando 2016 is a community driven event seeking to bring together anyone with a passion for making, breaking, or protecting.

A 2014 U.S. PIRG Education Fund report found that 65% of college students reported not purchasing a textbook due to cost, and 95% of those students said they suffered academically because of it. In response to this crisis, the use of Open Educational Resources (OER) is on the rise as post-secondary institutions and individual faculty members attempt to decrease educational costs for students and improve student success. The Hewlett Foundation defines OER as “teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others. Open education resources include full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge.”</p>\n<p>The information gathered by this survey about current efforts to reduce the costs of textbooks to students through the use of OER and other means will assist the Florida Virtual Campus (FLVC)* in establishing a statewide infrastructure to support these activities. The goal is to reach as many librarians, instructional technology/design staff, and teaching faculty as possible.</p>\n<p>The potential benefits of this study include lowered educational costs for students, increased support for the use of OER and other resources in the classroom, and professional development opportunities. The potential risks of participating in the survey are minimal. It will take about ten minutes to complete the survey.

Get a Flu shot!</p>\n<p>If you are in the habit of getting your flu shot every year, good for you! For those of you who don’t think you need a flu shot, consider the following: with more than 56,000 students on campus you WILL be exposed to the flu. If you catch the flu, you can expect to be out of school/work for up to 2 weeks recovering. Ask anyone who had the flu before, this is not something you can “tough out.” It will really wipe you out! Getting a flu shot is your best defense against catching the flu. </p>\n<p>The Health Center on campus offers flu shots to students for FREE with Student ID.

However, it is possible to catch the flu within 2 weeks of receiving your shot because your body has not built up the immunity yet. \n•   Trying to avoid people who have the flu will not protect you from catching it.

Like many gay men in the 1980s, Miguel moved from Puerto Rico to New York City; he found a career in theater and a rewarding relationship. Yet, on his deathbed he grappled to reconcile his homosexuality with his Catholic upbringing. Now, decades after his death, Cecilia locates Miguel’s lover Robert, who has been shunned and demonized by the family, in order to understand the whole story. Braiding recently discovered home movies, interviews, and contemporary vérité footage, Memories of a Penitent Heart dissects a family secret while exploring the AIDS crisis and the rarely heard story of Latino artists who died in the early days of the epidemic.

Examining both real-life stories and precedent-setting legal cases, director Kamala Lopez uncovers how outdated and discriminatory attitudes inform and influence seemingly disparate issues, from workplace harassment to domestic violence, rape and sexual assault to the foster care system, and the healthcare conglomerate to the judicial system. Along the way, she reveals the inadequacy of present laws that claim to protect women, ultimately presenting a compelling and persuasive argument for the urgency of ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment.\nThere will be a moderated discussion after the screening.</p>\n<p>Equal Pay Day is April 4th – and we have so many ways for you to join in!

These instruments generate spectroscopic or multi-elemental data. Although modern instruments generate data that consists of details about the elements that constitute the samples, the number of observations are usually limited. Analyzing multi-dimensional data where the number of observations are less than the number of dimensions (n &lt; p) has been a problem of interest in statistics for many years now. Commonly used statistical methods fail to analyze spectral data due to its high-dimensionality and insufficient sample observations in forensic laboratories. It is challenging to estimate variance-covariance matrices reliably for high-dimensional data that are required for Hotelling\'s T2 test, as well as, likelihood ratio computations using the formulae given by Aitken and Lucy in 2004. We propose three methods, two of which are used for dimensionality reduction of multi-elemental data (principal component analysis and random projections). The method of random projections is gaining popularity in high dimensional machine learning problems before performing clustering. We use the transformed data to calculate likelihood ratios for glass comparisons. The third method focuses on using spectral data for inks comparisons with the help of functional data analysis and the Hotelling’s T2 test statistic derived by Pini et al. (2018). In this talk, I will discuss how the three approaches affect the evidence comparisons.</p>\n<p><strong>Biography</strong></p>\n<p>Anjali Gupta is a Forensic Statistician who is pursuing PhD at the University of Auckland (New Zealand). She worked using glass, tapes and inks evidence and used data generated using LIBS, LA-ICP-MS, SEM-EDX and Raman spectroscopy during her PhD. She used both, Bayesian and Frequentist analysis, to compare forensic evidence. In particular, she based her research on the concepts of dimensionality reduction and functional data analysis. She completed her MSc in Applied Statistics at University of Oxford (UK) in 2011 after which she worked as a Statistician and Analytics Consultant for a few years before she started her doctoral research.</p>','2019-03-11','2019-03-13',NULL,'Matthieu Baudelet','4078236910','baudelet@ucf.edu','Matthieu Baudelet','Pending',188),(2850,'2019 Financial Wellness Series','2019-financial-wellness-series','<p>The annual <strong>UCF Financial Wellness Series</strong> will be held from April 1 through April 30, 2019.</p>\n<p>Schedules and descriptions of workshops and other series details: <a href=\"https://hr.ucf.edu/financial-wellness-series\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://hr.ucf.edu/financial-wellness-series</a><span>.</span></p>\n<p>For questions please contact <a href=\"mailto:benefits@ucf.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">benefits@ucf.edu</a>.</p>','2019-04-01','2019-04-30','https://hr.ucf.edu/current-employees/benefits/financial-wellness-series/','Venessa Williams','(407) 823-5187','Venessa.williams@ucf.edu','UCF HR Benefits','Publish',189),(2851,'Sick Leave Pool Open Enrollment','sick-leave-pool-open-enrollment-1-2','<p>The UCF Sick Leave Pool open enrollment is March 1 - March 29.

Joan is the Library Technical Assistant in the John C. Hitt Library. She has worked at the university since December 1986. Her nominators, Kristine Shrauger and Patricia Tiberii, had this to say about her:</p>\n<p><em>      “Joan or ‘Joanie’ to almost everyone in the library and on campus, is an exemplary UCF employee. She has worked the past 30 years, to support the students, faculty and staff in their research needs, providing a strong customer service for all in their pursuit for gathering sources. Her resourcefulness and perseverance in fulfilling requests for obscure and difficult-to-find materials has a direct impact on student and faculty research exemplifies her outstanding work ethic. Joanie’s efforts have been acknowledged within the dedications of faculty-published works and dissertations.</em></p>\n<p><em>     In addition to her daily responsibilities, she regularly volunteers her time by serving on a variety of UCF committees, taking on extra duties within the library and participating in UCF-led outreach opportunities throughout the greater Orlando community. Joanie plays an integral part within the UCF community and the university is lucky to have someone like her improving the academic quality and experience of our students, faculty and staff.”</em></p>\n<p>As USPS Employee of the Month, Joan receives a $200 cash award, $25 from UCF Business Services and UCF Bookstore, her name in lights on the UCF campus marquee, and an introduction to the Board of Trustees. She is now eligible for the USPS Employee of the Year $2,500 award, announced at the UCF Annual Awards Program.</p>\n<p>The University of Central Florida USPS Employee of the Month and Year Awards recognize exceptional performance of currently employed USPS staff.

Stillman Memorial Endowed Scholarship.</p>\n<p>Hammond is a junior majoring in anthropology. She plans to obtain a doctoral degree, specializing in biological anthropology, and to become a professor at an established research university. A first-generation student, she began working as a student assistant in circulation services in the John C. Hitt Library in August 2017. </p>\n<p>Hammond’s research career includes the McNair Scholars Program, the Research and Mentorship Program (RAMP), and presentations at UCF Undergraduate Research conferences. She has also participated in research fellowships, written manuscripts for publication in academic research journals, and worked with faculty mentor John Starbuck in UCF’s Morphometric Research Lab.</p>\n<p>Hammond has served as a mentor for UCF’s Resident Leadership Conference and is the current secretary of the Lambda Alpha Anthropology Honors Society. She has also been a resident assistant and a conference assistant with the UCF Department of Housing &amp; Residence Life, a role with which she credits with teaching her empathy and compassion in leadership.</p>\n<p>This is the 21st awarding of the Stillman scholarship, which is given to a student or staff member of the UCF Libraries. June S. Stillman was one of the first two librarians hired when UCF (then Florida Technological University) opened in 1968. Her impact on students can be seen from a 25th anniversary survey of the first graduating class, a majority of whom listed her as a key figure from their student days. Stillman received her second master’s degree in English Literature from UCF while working as the Head of Reference Services at the Library. She retired in 1996 and tragically passed away in 1998. Her friends and family established the June S. Stillman Memorial Endowed Scholarship in her honor.

Frank Imparato. Cpl. Imparato is a Law Enforcement Corporal in the UCF Police Department. He has been employed at UCF since January 2011. His nominators, Commander Scott Freeman and Commander James Mangan, had this to say about him:</p>\n<p><em>“On the first day UCF Police Department was providing law enforcement coverage at the new Downtown Campus, Cpl. Imparato responded to the scene of a construction incident where he found a gravely injured worker. Cpl. Imparato began performing life-saving care, including CPR on the worker, which allowed the worker to be saved and transported to the hospital. Without Cpl. Imparato’ s immediate care, the worker most likely would have died on the scene. In additional, Cpl. Imparato’s passion for helping others is demonstrated by being the UCF Police Department’s CPR Instructor and instructed many officers in how to provide lifesaving care.</em></p>\n<p><em>Cpl. Imparato’s actions to save the life of a stranger exemplifies the UCF Mission, Values and Goals</em><em> “.</em></p>\n<p>As USPS Employee of the Month, Cpl. Imparato receives a $200 cash award, $25 from UCF Business Services and UCF Bookstore, his name in lights on the UCF campus marquee, and an introduction to the Board of Trustees. He is now eligible for the USPS Employee of the Year $2,500 award, announced at the UCF Knight Star Awards Program.</p>\n<p>The University of Central Florida USPS Employee of the Month and Year Awards recognize exceptional performance of currently employed USPS staff.

It\'s no wonder that she was selected as the recipient of the Pegasus Advisor Award. This annual recognition honors an advisor who champions student success. CECS Advising Director Kim Small nominated Leonard. </p>\n<p>Leonard is an advisor in the College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS) and works with the college\'s students, faculty, and staff. She coordinates orientation and open houses, manages the BS-MS Program, oversees the scholarship process, and leads efforts to integrate the Pegasus Path into the academic planning process for engineering and computer science majors. In the past, she managed the CECS Academic Alert and CECS Academic Probation programs.</p>\n<p>\"Nina strives for excellence in her advising responsibilities,\" said Small. \"She is a true asset to our college and UCF. Our college is fortunate to have Nina as part of our team.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What\'s your favorite part of your job?</strong></p>\n<p>On my gosh, it\'s working with students! I remember a first-time college student who had a lot of accelerated credits. She was nervous about starting college. I was a little worried about her beginning upper-level courses during her first semester. We met each semester to talk about her classes and plan to graduation. She ended up staying at UCF to pursue a master\'s degree. It was fulfilling to see how her confidence increased and watch her academic career unfold. When she graduated, she brought me a card to thank me. Advising this student is a highlight of my career.</p>\n<p><strong>What\'s a typical day like as an advisor? </strong></p>\n<p>Every day is different. It always includes guiding CECS students to develop a plan for their future and make sure they stay on track. I love that I see a student\'s entire degree progression I help students to understand the university’s policies and degree requirements. I assist students with schedule planning, course selection, and navigating the many resources UCF has to offer. I link them with resources to increase academic success &amp; employability after graduation. </p>\n<p><strong>Sometimes, students have difficulties completing degree requirements. How do advisors help them get back on track? </strong></p>\n<p>It begins with building relationships with students. Advising goes beyond selecting classes. It\'s making sure that they know about available resources, such as the Pegasus Path and the Student Academic Resource Center. You also have to be willing to have those tough conversations. </p>\n<p>I led the CECS Early Alert Program that identifies students who are struggling and are at risk of extending their time to graduation or, in the worst case, leaving UCF. We work with the student to determine if the course load or the major is not right. Or, it might be time to refer them to the Student Academic Resource Center for tutoring or to the Knights Major Exploration and Transition Center to meet with an advisor who can help them select a degree program that aligns with their talents and future plans.</p>\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to advisors?</strong></p>\n<p>Some days can be hard, especially when you\'re having tough conversations with students. We need to give ourselves grace and make sure to recharge. It will make us better advisors. We need to show students that we\'re invested in their success. At the same time, let them know that they own their education.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you do in your spare time?</strong></p>\n<p>Spend time with my family. My husband Cameron is an Academic Advisor for the Rosen College of Hospitality Management at UCF. We have a three-year-old son and a daughter who\'s two. It\'s been interesting during the pandemic. I love watching them come up with new games and participate in hobbies that I like, such as Sudoku. I sometimes wonder what colleges they\'ll attend, what careers they\'ll choose, and hope they\'ll meet an advisor who will help them achieve their dreams. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>','2020-08-05','2020-08-15','https://www.cecs.ucf.edu/news/','CECS','(407) 823-2156','barbara.smith@ucf.edu','CECS','Publish',165),(3155,'UCF Physician Assumes New Role as Faculty in UCF-HCA Healthcare Endocrinology Fellowship','ucf-physician-assumes-new-role-as-faculty-in-ucf-hca-healthcare-endocrinology-fellowship','<p>As a young physician, Mustafa Kinaan helped build UCF’s new residency and fellowship programs. After five years of training, he’s staying in Greater Orlando to “care for the new family I love.”</p>\n<p>This month, Dr. Kinaan joins Premier Endocrinology in Kissimmee and St. Cloud also begins work at Osceola Regional Medical Center as a faculty member in the UCF-HCA Healthcare endocrinology fellowship. There, he will train doctors on the best ways to care for patients with conditions like diabetes, thyroid and pituitary gland diseases. It’s fitting for a physician who often told fellow residents that his goal in life was to cure diabetes.</p>\n<p>“Endocrinology is all about personalized care,” he said. “Diabetes is more than just giving your patient a pill. It’s working with patients to change their lifestyle – what they eat, their activity level. You spend more time with your patients and make deeper connections with them for life.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Kinaan graduated from Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar and did clerkship rotations and research at Cornell University in New York. There, he fell in love with endocrinology because it combined his passions for basic science and patient care. In 2014, UCF selected him as a resident for its inaugural residency program in internal medicine that was a partnership between the College of Medicine, the Orlando VA Medical Center and Osceola Regional. That residency has since grown to 28 graduate medical education programs training almost 500 physicians across Florida.</p>\n<p>After three years of caring for veterans and residents of Osceola County, one of Florida’s most diverse and fastest growing counties, Dr. Kinaan was selected as one of the program’s first chief residents. His responsibility – lead residents at one of the nation’s largest VA hospitals. “I have always had a passion for medical education,” he said. “I always learn better when I teach. Being chief was a fruitful opportunity to also learn about leadership, administration and to translate that into patient care for our nation’s veterans.” From there, he entered UCF’s endocrinology fellowship, a partnership between the medical school, HCA and the VA.</p>\n<p>Dr. Suzanne Quinn-Martinez leads that fellowship. “When I met Dr. Kinaan as an internal medicine resident, we didn’t have an Endocrinology Fellowship yet,” she said. “He was such a great candidate, we just had to build a fellowship around him and he never disappointed. We couldn’t let him leave to train anywhere else. We couldn’t be happier that he is staying in Osceola County. What an asset to the neighborhood and the medical community. “</p>\n<p>Doctors cannot care for patients immediately after they graduate from medical school. They must go first through residency training – three to seven years depending on the specialty. After residency, many go into fellowships for even more specialized training. Premier Endocrinology has been a strong clinical partner in training UCF-HCA residents and fellows.  Dr. Theresa Fynn, one of the owners of the practice, said Osceola County has an epidemic of Type 2 diabetes – in part because of the county’s large number of Hispanic residents, who are at high risk for the disease. She said the recent influx of residents from hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico has added to the community’s need for more endocrinologists. “When Dr. Kinaan was a fellow in our clinic, the patients loved him and kept asking when he was coming back. When we interviewed him he kept saying, ‘I want to be here and help this community.’”</p>\n<p>Dr. Abdo Asmar, UCF’s vice chair of internal medicine who leads the Greater Orlando Internal Medicine residency program, said the College of Medicine and HCA are focused on recruiting, training and retaining outstanding physicians so that graduates of the residency and fellowship programs remain in the community to care for residents.</p>\n<p>“This is why we started these programs,” Dr. Asmar said. “To bring more outstanding physicians to our community. “I couldn’t be happier. Whatever he does, Mustafa isn’t a sprinter, he’s a marathon runner. He is committed to building rapport and establishing long-term relationships with his patients. That’s what he loves.”</p>','2020-08-09','2020-08-19','https://med.ucf.edu/news/physician-staying-in-osceola-to-care-for-the-new-family-i-love/','Wendy Sarubbi','(407) 226-1418','wendy.sarubbi@ucf.edu','College of Medicine','Publish',165),(3156,'UCF Center Partners with Orlando-based United Abolitionists to Combat Human Trafficking','ucf-center-partners-with-orlando-based-united-abolitionists-to-combat-human-trafficking','<p>The Center for Public and Nonprofit Management (CPNM) and the Orlando nonprofit, United Abolitionists, are collaborating to pursue research, develop policy-related solutions, and educate and train students and community leaders on the problem of human trafficking. The U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline reported a nearly 25% increase in reported cases from 2017 to 2018 with thousands more cases still unreported.</p>\n<p>“Human trafficking is a significant challenge that the CPNM can be at the forefront of in terms of finding innovative public sector solutions. We serve as a liaison between the School of Public Administration faculty, who are uniquely positioned to engage in traditional or interdisciplinary research on human trafficking, and partners in the community. This collaboration offers opportunity to leverage our faculty expertise and build new knowledge in human trafficking research, while gaining insight from community leaders and practitioners. The CPNM is excited to be a part of this effort to bridge academia and practice, save lives and build a better world,” says Deborah A. Carroll, associate professor and director of the CPNM.</p>\n<p>The partnership also provides opportunities to educate and train students on the implications and signs of human trafficking and engages them in the policy development process for human rights issues. Maritza Concha, Ph.D., lecturer within the School of Public Administration, adds “This partnership will bring opportunities for our undergraduate and graduate students to explore research opportunities in human trafficking.”</p>\n<p>In just one month, the CPNM and United Abolitionists have submitted a research proposal to the National Science Foundation, collaborated on the production of a research paper to be submitted to a leading peer-reviewed journal and designed a survey to capture the effect COVID-19 is having on anti-trafficking and victim service organization operations around the world.</p>\n<p>“With its focus on research in public policy and administration as well as its goal of bridging academia, government and the nonprofit community, the CPNM is a key enabler to building understanding in the public, using research to help develop more informed policies and helping nonprofits and other nongovernmental organizations be more effective in their missions,” explains Tomas J.

These surveys were administered in February and March, clearly capturing the voices of a small population of our campus. Much has changed since then. The pandemic has ravaged the globe, and thousands have joined forces to march against racism, brutality and bigotry. Like the cries for greater equality ringing across the country, our climate survey also found discrepancies in how different groups perceive they are treated at UCF, concerns that their contributions are not being recognized and a lack of transparency.

Officer Nelson applied a tourniquet and clotting agent to control the bleeding until fire rescue could arrive on scene.</em></p>\n<p><em> </em><em>Officer Nelson was able to help save a life due to three reasons: 1. Even though he was on his way home, he was prepared with all his equipment and ready to go at a moment’s notice, 2. Officer Nelson had situational awareness to see someone flagging him down and his mind was ready for action, and 3. Officer Nelson cares about others and is always ready to help, no matter when or where that might occur.</em></p>\n<p><em> </em><em>By stopping to assist someone with a gunshot wound, Officer Nelson was showing a commitment to UCF\'s Mission/Creed of being a positive impact on our community. Citizens of our Orlando community saw a marked UCF Police car, a uniformed UCF Police Officer and most importantly, a UCF Knight helping someone in need.

Or does it?</p>\n<p>Our modern system of tastes that seem so “naturally” preferable to us are very different from those of the past. The perfect meal of ancient Pompeii and the Roman World was one where all the tastes, and therefore all the virtues, would be simultaneously present. These tastes developed a model of cuisine based on the blending of a multitude of flavors and textures rather than being singular or distinct. This “structure of taste,” strongly correlated with the philosophy and worldview of those living in Pompeii, at times serves as a barrier for us in understanding a reality so different from our own.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Speaker Biography: </strong>Dr. Lana Williams a bioarchaeologist specializing in research of human health and diet. She received her PhD in 2008 from University of Western Ontario and was awarded the Governor General’s Academic Gold Medal in 2009.

Those efforts include studies using contextual analysis and microscopic use-wear signatures to identify tattooing tools in archaeological collections, projects to systematically document tattoos on ancient preserved human remains, and experiments recreating and testing ancient and historic tattooing implements.</span></p>\n<p><span>In 2009, Aaron organized the first American academic symposium to examine ancient and early historic Native American tattooing, which culminated in the volume Drawing with Great Needles: Ancient Tattoo Traditions of North America. He has participated in international symposia on ancient body modification, authored multiple research publications on the archaeological identification of tattooing artifacts, and is co-editor of the volume Ancient Ink: The Archaeology of Tattooing, the first-ever book dedicated to the global archaeological study of tattooing. In recent years Aaron was part of research teams which identified a 2,000-year old cactus spine tattooing tool from southern Utah, and 5,000-year old turkey bone tattooing tools from Tennessee.

We will also travel through the recent uses of lasers for mapping Pompeii that allow us to be part of the city and unveil the knowledge of this civilization after all these years.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Speaker Biography: </strong>Dr. Matthieu BAUDELET is an associate professor specializing in chemical analysis for forensic research. He graduated with a <a href=\"http://M.Sc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">M.Sc</a>. in \"Laser and Spectroscopy\" in the University of Lyon (France) and continued to complete his Ph.D. in the \'Laboratoire de Spectrométrie Ionique et Moléculaire\' (Lasim, Lyon) working on \"Laser-induced plasma and spectroscopic analysis\" under the direction of Pr. Jin YU in 2008. From 2008 to 2015, as a Senior Scientist and then Research Assistant Professor of Optics in the Laser &amp; Plasma Laboratory in the Townes Laser Institute at UCF, he was introducing and developing laser spectroscopy for atomic spectroscopy as well as electronic, vibrational and rotational molecular spectroscopy for studying fundamentals of plasmas, quantitative analysis and sensing in tabletop and integrated configuration as well as for stand-off detection. Now Faculty member of the Chemistry department in the National Center for Forensic Science at the University of Central Florida, his research focuses on the application of spectroscopic techniques for forensic analysis. He is focusing on evidence such as tire skid marks, pollen grains and anthropological remains. He also develops matrix-matched analytical standards of hard biomaterials for laser-ablation techniques.

The exclusion of these scholars slowed the development of the discipline and simultaneously provided space for White scholars to be falsely credited for advances made by early Black sociologists many years prior.</p>\n<p>This lecture examines the contributions of Black Americans to the discipline of sociology in the United States with an emphasis on those at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Moving beyond the tremendous exploits of W. E. B. Du Bois and the Atlanta Sociological Laboratory, the significant sociological contributions of Black men and women at Atlanta University, Fisk University, Howard University and Tuskegee Institute are placed in their proper historical and contemporary context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Speaker biography: </p>\n<p>Dr. Earl Wright, II is a tenured professor at Rhodes College in Memphis, TN. Dr. Wright received his Ph.D. from the University of Nebraska, and previously served on the faculty at the University of Cincinnati, Texas Southern University (as Chairperson of the Department of Sociology), Fisk University, and University of Central Florida.</p>\n<p>Dr. Wright’s primary research and teaching interests are on the contributions of Blacks to American sociology and the sociology of hip hop. In 2016, he was selected by the Southern Sociological Society (SSS) as the recipient of the Charles S. Johnson Award for excellence in research on race and the South and was recently elected president of SSS.</p>\n<p>While at the University of Cincinnati, Dr. Wright co-founded an initiative that promoted community-partnered research relationships with local stakeholders. Having been reared less than two miles from Rhodes’ campus, Dr. Wright is very excited about the opportunity to continue his community engaged works in his hometown and the neighborhoods where he once lived.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For more information: <a href=\"https://sciences.ucf.edu/sociology/a-well-dressed-lie-and-the-naked-truth/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://sciences.ucf.edu/sociology/cos-talks</a></p>','2021-01-29','2021-02-12','https://sciences.ucf.edu/sociology/a-well-dressed-lie-and-the-naked-truth/','UCF College of Sciences',NULL,'COSMarketing@ucf.edu','UCF College of Sciences','Publish',278),(3248,'Be My Neighbor Day - Celebrate Kindness All Month Long','be-my-neighbor-day-celebrate-kindness-all-month-long','<p>Join us in celebrating kindness with Be My Neighbor Day activities, virtual events, and a Daniel Tiger TV special throughout the month of February.</p>\n<p>GRR-IFIC Neighbors with Daniel Tiger<br>What: Daniel Tiger and friends celebrate what it means to be a caring neighbor with music, story time and at-home activities.<br>When: Saturday and Sunday, February 27 and 28 at 8:30 and 10 a.m.<br>Where: WUCF TV, watch on-air or online at<span> </span><a href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwucf.org%2Flive%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2NSC10YKSUkFinnk82EpYN3JcMg_YoiMTUuqsnWbUWuCC2sdZtJq7WjFQ&amp;h=AT0blcOTv4A-kgyfanpihnT-rZBCtzuJNdo84bdluZQ09E5G-Kqp3F1ex_MNOcxATJ_2hTVUQHDR0c15l4uGo7A22BrYmW8v2Y2kjJuxnKvrFwSzQ-FJ1I9dIaT29S5Lflo_7psythOTaZUbfXOPzQ&amp;__tn__=q&amp;c[0]=AT13dRMiwA6TpqzxU6XrWnZ7YInUYPGdpsjOV5C6hpCYCDts5fsfCHrYYiS-T9p0e0soJs6Dx8BdlE62OVzzZ9HOL8lY4joaAXDj5UKPWFHlf0Bsd9sVcms8lvdw6g32DE-TougF1LrzWrS5KxBs8UpG7GxVWwbiIqhtfHvkHE7W51RQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">wucf.org/live</a></p>\n<p>Kindness Kits<br>What: The Be My Neighbor Day kindness kit includes seven at-home activities for celebrating kindness and what it means to be a caring neighbor.

In this talk, she will explore how both theory production and a legacy of race mythmaking in biological anthropology have constrained interpretations of who constitutes kin across our species. Much of the public\'s understanding of \"normal\" human behavior is undergirded by spurious racial hierarchies, and these ideas influence what we construe to be normal familial configurations and behaviors.</p>\n<p>Using her comparative study of the growth and development of children living in state-regulated residential childcare facilities as compared to those living with their natal kin as an empirical anchor, she will discuss how pseudo-economic models of kin investment and racist ideas about proper families have influenced our study of what children need to survive and thrive. Findings from this research reveal associations between childrearing practices, place of residence, and gender-specific variability in the health outcomes of Jamaican boys and girls. This research explores the many ways that children come to embody the psychosocial and physical environments provided by their caretakers, and the broad flexibility in how kin is conceived in different cultural contexts. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Speaker Biography:</p>\n<p><span>Robin Nelson is a biological anthropologist who utilizes evolutionary theory in studies of human sociality and health outcomes. Her doctoral research examined variability in received investment from kin and social contacts and phenotypic expression of biological trait indicators of health status amongst Jamaican adults. Her more recent work explores the relationship between health outcomes and residential context for Jamaican children. This project focuses on the growth and development of children living in state-sponsored residential childcare facilities. She examines what happens to the social and physical health of children when the home, as it is articulated in West Indian communities, is not available to them. She is currently developing a project exploring the lives of Caribbean immigrants and their children in Toronto, Canada. With a focus on critical periods of growth and development, she investigates culturally salient forms of social and financial capital and the health of peoples from the Caribbean.</span></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p><span>For more information: <a href=\"https://sciences.ucf.edu/cos-talks/bridging-theory-and-building-kin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://sciences.ucf.edu/cos-talks/bridging-theory-and-building-kin/\">https://sciences.ucf.edu/cos-talks/bridging-theory-and-building-kin/</a></span></p>','2021-02-23','2021-03-05','https://sciences.ucf.edu/cos-talks/bridging-theory-and-building-kin/','UCF College of Sciences',NULL,'COSMarketing@ucf.edu','UCF College of Sciences','Publish',278),(3263,'Pioneers of Sociology: The Life & Legacy of Ida B.

Shirley is always the first to volunteer to do work behind the scenes that will make the jobs of her staff easier and better. She does these things with humility in that she truly wants to assist and serve the greater good, which is to serve our students, faculty, and staff.

His research — spanning such areas as African American student achievement and success as well as multicultural and social justice issues in counseling — has been widely presented and published at the national and international levels.</p>\n<p>“Kent’s knowledge and practice in the helping profession and higher education have enabled him to gain perspectives and experiences to develop him into a resourceful professional regarding so many issues that many seek his advice,” says nominator Leo M. Lachut, director of academic support at UConn. “He has an amazing ability to connect and engage with students of all ages and demonstrated his commitment and passion for supporting first-generation students.”  </p>\n<p>Among his many accolades, Butler has been recognized by UCF as a Faculty Fellow for Inclusive Excellence, a Tennessee Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development Appreciation Award winner, and an American Counseling Association Fellow.</p>\n<p>He is also a fellow with the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.

The Cassini spacecraft explored the ringed planet and its moons and rings from 2004-2017 and has helped us solve many of its mysteries while generating a wealth of new questions. This presentation will follow Cassini’s journey of discovery through the Saturn system, from the bizarre mountains of Iapetus to the geysers of Enceladus, the lakes of Titan, and the dynamic and evolving rings.</p>\n<p>Cassini’s instruments have revealed Enceladus and Titan to have subsurface oceans of liquid water. Its cameras have returned stunning images of rings in turmoil, a tumbling moon, the only extraterrestrial lakes known in the solar system, a hexagon of clouds, some of the highest mountains in the solar system and much more. Its final orbits featured a daring plunge between the rings and the cloud tops where measurements revealed the planet’s interior to be more mysterious than imagined shed new light on the age and origin of the rings.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaker biography: </strong></p>\n<p>Dr. Joshua Colwell is a Pegasus Professor of Physics at the University of Central Florida. Since 2011 he has been Associate Chair of the Department of Physics, Assistant Director of the Florida Space Institute, and Director of the Center for Microgravity Research. He came to UCF in 2006 from the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado where he earned his Ph.D. in Astrophysical, Planetary, and Atmospheric Sciences.</p>\n<p>His research interests are in the origin and evolution of the solar system with a particular emphasis on planet formation, asteroids, planetary rings, comets, and interplanetary dust. He was a Co-Investigator on the international Cassini mission to Saturn that orbited the ringed planet from 2004-2017. He studies the structure and dynamics of Saturn’s rings with data from Cassini. He has led experiments that have flown on the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station, suborbital rockets, and parabolic airplane flights.</p>\n<p>For more information on this talk:<span> <a href=\"https://sciences.ucf.edu/launch-break/the-ringed-planet/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sciences.ucf.edu/launch-break/the-ringed-planet</a></span></p>','2021-04-15','2021-04-28','https://sciences.ucf.edu/launch-break/the-ringed-planet/','UCF College of Sciences','(407) 823-0120','COSMarketing@ucf.edu','UCF College of Sciences','Publish',278),(3287,'Extreme Explorers: Challenges of Exploring our Planetary Neighbors','extreme-explorers-challenges-of-exploring-our-planetary-neighbors','<p><strong>Tuesday, May 4</strong><br><strong>Noon - 1 pm EDT</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ucf.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7UGxn5k8iPINC8C\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RSVP Here</strong></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Join us for lunch in space with our Launch Break!

Not only she engaged with and transformed several aspects of the department\'s administrative operation, but also did so with enough empathy and consideration to others that the overall environment has improved significantly. You may have noticed that the Department of Physics is constantly featured in the UCF News postings recently, and this is primarily driven by Ms. Campbell chasing and helping produce stories that recognize the success of our students and faculty.</em></p>\n<p><em>UCF and Physics is lucky to have Nikitta. She consistently goes above and beyond to help anyone in the Department, whether it be the Chair, faculty, staff, or student. Her enthusiasm does not wane, and she puts forth 110% on anything she undertakes. She manages the Department with respect and diplomacy and has the best interest of everyone in the Department at heart. She shows grit and determination, but also kindness and integrity when working through a problem. She is a ray of light each day and a true pleasure to work alongside with”.</em></p>\n<p>As USPS Employee of the Month, Nikitta receives a $200 cash award, $25 from UCF Business Services and UCF Bookstore, and a goody bag.

She intends to graduate with her bachelor’s in Spring 2022 and wants to pursue a master’s Degree in secondary education with a language arts track.</span><span></span></p>\n<p><span>Her volunteer experience includes over 500 hours of volunteer work, including leading “Care for Kids,” which included collecting and distributing holiday ornaments and gifts and volunteering at summer camps at her local church. She is also a certified soccer referee and coach.

June S. Stillman was one of the first two librarians hired when UCF (then Florida Technological University) opened in 1968. Her impact on students can be seen from a 25th anniversary survey of the first graduating class, a majority of whom listed her as a key figure from their student days. Stillman received her second master’s degree in English Literature from UCF while working as the Head of Reference Services at the Library. She retired in 1996 and tragically killed in 1998. Her friends and family established the June S. Stillman Memorial Endowed Scholarship in her honor. She is remembered as a consummate professional, the epitome of gentility and compassion, and a proponent of lifelong learning.              </span><span></span></p>','2021-07-01','2021-07-31',NULL,'UCF Libraries','(407) 823-2564','infolit@ucf.edu','UCF Communications','Publish',166),(3317,'Opening Reception: Spring 2022 BFA Exhibition I','opening-reception-spring-2022-bfa-exhibition-i','<p><strong><em>Spring 2022 BFA Exhibition I</em></strong> provides the opportunity for senior undergraduate students majoring in book arts, ceramics, drawing, illustration, painting, photography, printmaking, and sculpture to share their research and artistic practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Opening Reception:</strong> Thursday, March 24 from 5-7 p.m. <a href=\"https://ci.ovationtix.com/34486/production/1066899\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Register Here</a><br> Need help registering?

Microsoft Teams expands on the capabilities in Skype for Business by bringing together files, chats, and apps in an integrated app, with functionality that enables organizations to move faster and collaborate more efficiently. Because of the richer set of experiences offered in Teams, it replaces Skype for Business as the core communications client for Office 365.</p>\n<p>In partnership with Microsoft, UCF IT would like to minimize impact to the university and voice services through an expedited migration. To minimize the transition impact for faculty and staff, the full implementation from Skype for Business to Teams will now occur over UCF\'s spring break – the night of March 4 through March 13, 2022. Traditionally this week has reduced system activity and personnel on campus which leads to less client impact during business hours.</p>\n<p>Prior to the night of March 4, UCF IT staff will be dispersed throughout campus to upgrade 821 “Audio Code Phones” that are currently non-compliant with Teams voice. The following models will be upgraded to support Teams voice service: AudioCodes 405HD, 420HD, 440HD, 445HD, 450HD. The model number can be found on the top of your phone.</p>\n<p>In preparations for the migration, you are being asked to use Microsoft Teams for all chats, conversations, and audio/video meetings, including one-to-one audio and video calls.</p>\n<p>UCF IT is sponsoring multiple Microsoft-led virtual training for Microsoft Teams Calling. The training is relevant to all faculty and staff migrating to Microsoft Teams Calling from Skype for Business. There will be a dedicated Q&amp;A time at the end of the training, and participants can also ask questions throughout the session through the chat feature.

His nominators had this to say about him:</p>\n<p>“Sgt. Elliot has worked for UCF Police Department since March 2007. In that time, he has served in different ranks, but he is always one of the most active employees in the department and does whatever he can to help in every situation he encounters. In January 2022, Sgt Elliot was working patrol on the main campus when he was flagged down by a family of four (mother, father and two sons) who were from the Netherlands on vacation in Orlando. They were lost and looking for the Health Department. While on vacation in Orlando, the parents contracted COVID-19. This can be scary enough, but when you are in a foreign country with no support system it can be overwhelming and terrifying. Because of their infections, they were unable to fly home until testing negative. The mother tested negative, but the father continued to test positive 12 days after initially testing positive. Their embassy was not able to help them, and their finances were running out in Orlando. Sgt Elliot told them they might be able to get a clearance from a doctor even though the test keeps being positive. Elliot contacted local urgent care centers and was able to find them a doctor who said they could come in and he would see what he could do to help them. Sgt Elliot also gave the two sons stuffed animals to help brighten their days. On his next shift, Elliot received a text message from the family. They had arrived home in the Netherlands and said that they would have never made it home without him! They said their son named his stuffed animal Elliot after him.</p>\n<p>Elliot is constantly looking for ways he can help others while on duty and off. Elliot works hard to keep people safe on campus and thinks outside of the box in a progressive, professional, and innovative way. Elliot working with community partners to make a big impact in the lives of these visitors to the UCF Campus.”</p>\n<p><span>As USPS Employee of the Month, Elliot receives a one-time $200 cash award, $25 from UCF Business Services, $25 from UCF Bookstore, and a goody bag.

Throughout 2021, Corporal Stephens took on the additional duty and responsibility for the vacant Special Events role at UCFPD. Corporal Stephens continuously stepped in to assist with campus events and activities, taking on the very, very, large task of putting together the operations plan, staffing hundreds of law enforcement personnel from all around Central Florida and countless other details that outsiders have no idea what is done behind the scenes to pull off such large-scale events.</p>\n<p>Corporal Stephens is the man you see working on the message boards, hear on the phone coordinating personnel from other agencies, juggling staffing at the last minute, and one of the many who worked way past 2 a.m. that first game of the season and still came in early the next morning to start working on the next football game. Corporal Stephens is a tireless wonder that is always busy making things happen; however, watching the many long hours he put in working with everyone to ensure that the public safety aspect of these events is taken care of did not go unnoticed.

The leadership and staff of the UCF’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) have, for many years, recognized Mr. Lewis as a true “champion” of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Hank has supported ODI’s work with enthusiasm, creativity, passion, and energy.

Price’s lecture, titled “Richard Nixon Was the Last Liberal Republican President. Counterintuitive? Maybe. Accurate? Yes,” will take a fresh look at Nixon’s social policies and the ongoing relevance of the arguments for and against them.</p>\n<p>The lecture, based on Price’s memoir <em>The Last Liberal Republican</em>, will explore key moments in Nixon’s presidency that have since been overshadowed by Watergate and other scandals of the administration. As a member of the administration, Price helped develop domestic policies on welfare, hunger and health that have led him to place Nixon “firmly in the liberal Republican tradition.”</p>\n<p>Among the policies to be explored in the lecture are the Family Assistance Plan — Nixon’s guaranteed income proposal — and the administration\'s sweeping universal health insurance proposals, which included coverage of pre-existing conditions 40 years before the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>“Richard Nixon was the eager and willing continuation, even dramatic expansion, of the moderate or liberal trajectory of the Republican Party,” says Price. “Nixon’s social policies and the arguments for and against them at the time have resonance — even repetition — today.”</p>\n<p> </p>','2022-03-23','2022-03-28','https://ucf.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Rzugyf8URWiXzEKBnBnBog','Nicole Wills',NULL,'Nicole.Wills@ucf.edu','UCF Communications and Marketing','Publish',166),(3427,'Virtual Employer Information Session: The Resource Group','virtual-employer-information-session-the-resource-group','<p>Experiential Learning is hosting a virtual informational session with The Resource Group on Tuesday, March 29, 2022 from 4p.m - 5p.m. S<span>tudents will be hearing from members of The Resource Group\'s Analytics Community on their experiences and current internship and full-time opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span>The Resource Group operates as the second largest and most efficient resource and supply management organization in healthcare delivery by focusing on effective change management and the caregiver experience. </span></p>\n<p><span>This session is open to ALL MAJORS! </span></p>\n<p><span>Register in advance for this meeting: <a href=\"https://ucf.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAtd-Goqz4vGdFChbVTqRy4hDmfWFztHyMd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://ucf.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAtd-Goqz4vGdFChbVTqRy4hDmfWFztHyMd</a> </span></p>\n<p>After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.</p>','2022-03-29','2022-03-29','https://ucf.joinhandshake.com/events/1009432/share_preview','Madhvi Acharya','(407) 823-1004','madhvi.acharya@ucf.edu','Experiential Learning','Pending',230),(3428,'Creating and Maintaining an Effective LinkedIn Presence with CVS Health','creating-and-maintaining-an-effective-linkedin-presence-with-cvs-health','<p><span>Experiential Learning is hosting a virtual professional development workshop with CVS on Wednesday, March 30, 2022 from 5p.m - 6p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span>In this workshop, students will learn from professionals at CVS Health on how to enhance your LinkedIn profile, how to build a network of contacts, and the do’s and don’ts of using this networking website. </span></p>\n<p><span>This session is open to ALL Majors!</span></p>\n<p><span>Register in advance for this meeting: <a href=\"https://ucf.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEtduirrDosGNE9DswBm3nWJYNgwun1wwpZ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://ucf.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEtduirrDosGNE9DswBm3nWJYNgwun1wwpZ</a></span></p>\n<p>After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.</p>','2022-03-30','2022-03-30','https://ucf.joinhandshake.com/events/975837/share_preview','Madhvi Acharya','(407) 823-1004','madhvi.acharya@ucf.edu','Experiential Learning','Pending',230),(3429,'Spring 2022 UCF Downtown Employer Networking Event!

His nominators had this to say about him:</p>\n<p><em>“</em><em>Paul has been a consistent model in our department of what it means to lead through change. He maintains over 16 Recreation and Wellness facility sites that all have unique needs to upkeep. We had many large-scale projects this fiscal year that required moving, replacing, and fixing hundreds of pieces of fitness equipment to repurpose for safe distancing as well as to prepare for a large-scale flooring project. Paul has also acquired an expertise in maintaining swimming pools which are challenging to keep up when we have few maintenance staff that have appropriate skill set and certifications. While many measure success on what gets added to programs and services, it needs noted that intangible successes include seeing issues ahead of time and putting out the fires to prevent any closures and stalls in the overall operation of the Recreation and Wellness Center. Paul has embraced excellence in the work he takes on. He connects with the student staff at a high level as he is approachable and in turn builds on the community which embodies UCF values.</em></p>\n<p><em>First and foremost, Paul has a unique skill set that has been put to great use that specifically addresses the needs at the Recreation and Wellness Center. Paul has the responsibility for maintaining a 150,000-square-foot indoor recreation facility along with two satellite facilities. With over 400 fitness machines and a continuous cycle of large maintenance projects continuously needing attention and upkeep, Paul is extremely efficient in timing the repairs and addressing any trouble spots. In addition, Paul assists with outside facilities which include 2 pools, grass and turf fields, volleyball courts, tennis courts, and Lake Claire. Paul has been working on site with various transitions in phases to keep up with the continuous changes arising from the pandemic to meet the needs of students.

In an era of rapid technological change, shrinking protections for workers, and growing income inequality, work is no longer the secure, stable, predictable path to economic stability that it once was for some segments of the population. Instead, organizations today focus on shedding labor, cutting costs, and increasing shareholder returns. At the same time, however, many organizations also profess an interest in meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse population. How do they manage the tensions of adapting to these neoliberal ideals in a more multiracial society?</p>\n<p>This research study focuses on Black professionals in the healthcare industry to answer this question. Using in depth interviews, field observations, and survey data analysis, I show how work transformation fundamentally changes the labor Black professionals do within and outside of organizations. This labor varies by occupational status and gender, leaving Black men and Black women with divergent responsibilities depending on their position in the organizational hierarchy. Ultimately, this research identifies new challenges for organizations and reveals an additional way that racial inequality gets perpetuated in the new economy.</p>\n<p><strong>More Information:</strong> <a href=\"https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fripmzh%2Fvlqwj50%2Fripyw1&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cbridgett.burk%40ucf.edu%7C61ebf474d7de4f0fc3b408da869c7633%7Cbb932f15ef3842ba91fcf3c59d5dd1f1%7C0%7C0%7C637970303811008800%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ly6can9MfNI0BXes7%2FzX8kUMTkl2EQOYc1NpFLYpL%2B0%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://bit.ly/3cisiF8</a></p>\n<p><strong>Wingfield\'s Bio:</strong> <a href=\"https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fripmzh%2Fvlqwj50%2F7aqyw1&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cbridgett.burk%40ucf.edu%7C61ebf474d7de4f0fc3b408da869c7633%7Cbb932f15ef3842ba91fcf3c59d5dd1f1%7C0%7C0%7C637970303811008800%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=TFV2pyQrOMfXRTRZ8roeK0iO7j4OUtnPb%2BGYQT9ROBQ%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://bit.ly/3RaXIvQ</a></p>','2022-08-25','2022-09-15','https://events.ucf.edu/event/2531399/dr-adia-wingfield-professional-work-in-a-post-racial-era-black-health-care-workers-in-the-new-economy/','Amy Donley','(407) 823-3744','amy.donley@ucf.ed','Department of Sociology','Publish',294),(3461,'Sick Leave Pools Open Enrollment','sick-leave-pools-open-enrollment-1','<p>Open enrollment for the UCF Sick Leave Pools is Sept. 1-30, 2022.
